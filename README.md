# COVID-19 Awareness Website

This repository contains a **COVID-19 Awareness Website** I developed as part of a Cloud Computing Lab project. The website serves as an information platform to spread awareness about COVID-19, providing users with a guide on preventive measures like proper hand-washing techniques. The project was successfully deployed on **Google Firebase**, leveraging its Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) features for hosting, storage, and scalability.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project was to create a web application that educates users about COVID-19 and promotes preventive practices. Key features include:
- A guide on how to wash hands properly (e.g., steps like "Palm to Palm," "Between the Fingers").
- Information on how COVID-19 spreads across the globe.
- A responsive and user-friendly interface for accessibility.

The project was developed and deployed using **Firebase**, which provided a scalable cloud platform for hosting and managing the application. The development process involved setting up Firebase hosting, configuring deployment files, and optionally integrating GitHub Actions for automated deploys.

### Key Achievements
- **Cloud Deployment**: Successfully deployed the website on Firebase using its PaaS features.
- **User Education**: Provided actionable guides to help users stay safe during the pandemic.
- **Scalable Infrastructure**: Leveraged Firebase’s scalability to ensure the website could handle varying levels of traffic.
